Bank Simulation with Basic Operations using HashMap

We have list of customer names, and account balance
create and fill the list by the user. Then show a menu to do following:
1. Balance Enquiry by name (the user gives the name and gets the balance)
2. Deposit (add money to the balance)
3. Withdrawal (subtract money from the balance)
4. Transfer (transfer money from customer to customer) 
0. Exit

The system has to keep showing the menu until the user presses 0

Explain the transactions :
1. Balance: the user enters the customer name, the system displays the balance
2. Deposit: the user enters the customer name, and amount to deposit. the system add that amount to that customer
3. Withdrawal: the user enters the customer name, and amount to take, the system subtracts that amount from that customer
4. Transfer: the user enters customer who sends, and amount of money, and customers who receives. The system take that amount from the sender to receiver
